I got leukemia when I was 20 when I was in West Africa And I was medevacs Out of West Africa on a chartered medevac flight a Learjet 60 That's significant because It's a hell of a plane And then I flew in Germany for a couple of days and diagnosed me And then kind of and flew back here on the Fourth of July and 2010 And it wasn't that long after that But I met Suzanne And she She worked nights and she would come in and like you know like all nurses like she kind of picks up the pieces after the doctors came and went and they left and they gave you bad news And then the nurses were there and they you know they sit there and they hold your hand and they cry with you or whatever And Suzanne was you know she was really Sweet as she became part of our family And I just devolves it's really a great relationship with her And then she told me about her dream a couple of years ago to open a palliative care home in Seattle Where People could go when they were to When they were too sick to go home when they needed the care That was more than their families could provide and my and my parents did so much I mean home infusions and dressing changes and I mean I had I was taking 60 pills at one point In one day [00:01:48][918]And they did all of that and they made lists and they made all the stuff and they did a lot And you know but there were times when it was my dad more than I could handle at home And so when that happened I stayed in the hospital But even though like it was it was a situation where like it's Like too sick to go home and to well to be in the hospital So [00:02:10][213]you stay in the hospital And we had really good insurance and so that I got it paid for But In 2011 I was out of the hospital for 73 days and the rest of the days I was in the hospital and I got hospital infections I got you know in just a really [00:02:27][168]Really bad mood and angry and upset and sad And I missed my dog I had a pug Whose name was Oliver and he was delightful I never got to see him And And like home when I missed all of that and I had to stay in the hospital and it was miserable And you know like having nurses like Suzanne Really made it better But Like when she told me about Ladybug House that's the that's the missing link because I mean you know people Are Speaking for myself like that I could have gone to the Ladybug House it is perfect for me And I could have seen Oliver the bag and we could have hung out and played in the grass And I think I don't understand why a city like Seattle doesn't have something like that For young people especially young people you know one there like I was and I was in college and you know my friends would come up from Oregon where I was going to school [00:03:30][612]And like there were visiting hours and they had to leave by a certain time Suzanne did not enforce The visiting hours rule because she gets it And you know what does this get so limiting to be in the hospital you know you can't eat your independence is completely curtailed I mean especially if you're in your early 20s like I was or a kid or whatever But like a place like Lydia House Would give you that independence back And sure like you know Ladybug House isn't going to cure you from cancer is not going to do that It's going to give you back as much as you as much of your life As As [00:04:08][371]As you can get And I think you know I think that makes all the difference Because you know I was still a 20 year old you know I still wanted to I mean you know see my friends and see And [00:04:24][133]Just like not you know not be in the hospital all the time I mean you know I've never been I think I've been to the hospital one time in my life when I got sick and then all of a sudden it became my home I'm like it's a pretty crappy home The food's terrible and there's always bells and things ringing all the time and there's no overhead announcements about you know somebody is coding or whatever All this other stuff [00:04:47][217]And the site you can never get peace and quiet you could never be You never feel alone You never feel like if your friend comes over and stays with you Like it's a really weird environment for your friends to come by Like oh you know I'm going to go visit Bill in the hospital [00:05:03][148]Like that's like I had a friend who just when he couldn't do it my best friend He couldn't do it And that you know I think Like Ladybug House could give you that part of you back It could make you feel like yourself again And So when Suzanne told me about the dream I thought if anybody could do this Suzanne can She's got the heart She's got the experience she's got the Just got everything you need And I think it's a gift that's Seattle needs to give itself Because there are so many people in this community that need it And It just it just would make people's lives so much better And you know the thing about you know the thing about cancer like you know maybe go up to someone and And you know tell them about the palliative care house but it feels for him it feels like well that's not my experience that's not my life But The thing of it is is In May of 2010 this wasn't my life either And there was one day When it became my life It was July 1st And I was in Germany And on And on May June Sorry This is crazy Please at this hour What's the month before July Damn it May [00:06:27][834]God this is really embarrassing Anyway so on May 31 like cancer wasn't my experience The need for a palliative care home for people was that wasn't my experience But [00:06:42][136]It can become your life in an instant And You know all of them and there's there's a moment when you're sitting in the room with the doctor and he hasn't told you the cancer yet And then he does And then everything changes And it might not be like you know a palliative care home for the Seattle area and migh not feel like something that applies to you But [00:07:06][216]There's nothing that says that it won't necessarily some day apply to you It is horrible and it's terrible But a place like Ladybug House would make it so much better And you know if it's not it is you know if it's not your kid and it's not your brother and it's not your sister it's somebody else's brother or sister or somebody else's son or daughter And You know you would want if it was if it was your family You would stop at nothing [00:07:37][293]To help them [00:07:38][03]You would do whatever it takes Why Because people [00:08:04][242]Because it's sad when kids get cancer It breaks my heart into a million pieces I it's it's Horrible It's wrong And it's I mean you know But the thing is people don't want to talk about it That's what it comes down to you like You know it's a terrible way to start a conversation Oh let's talk about You know all of the Like kids getting cancer it's a terrible conversation starter But the thing is Like Yeah like I said earlier like it may not be your life now But You might wake up some morning and that day could become your life [00:08:50][422]In one day it could become your life You know and and if you don't like there are people like my like myself and my family like we don't have a choice [00:08:59][81]But the thing about pediatric cancer because it's our life now And I think That [00:09:06][61]You know to basically think that that's not a part of your life and thinking and talking about pediatric cancer isn't a part of your life because you know because that's just how it turned out to be Oh [00:09:23][150]Yeah Like it's just set You know like there's people like my family where like we have to think about it like that choice got taken away from us in July of 2010 And You know I think that just because that That That whole world wasn't chosen for you By fate or whatever you know like however you're like you know biology microbiology and like the stuff in the cell cycle and the whole thing like just because it wasn't chosen for you and you were forced to think about it I don't think it's Not a good reason to not think about it anyway Because [00:10:07][424]It happens to anybody you know I mean I was 20 years old I just finished to do my junior year of college I was doing great I had a job I had a great car I had to get like a girlfriend I had everything And You know what I didn't I didn't think about cancer I didn't think about childhood I didn't think about any of that stuff because I didn't have to And then you know once I got sick I had to think about it But I think You know I think that it would have served me well to talk about it [00:10:41][327]Even if even though it is uncomfortable because there are people everywhere around us that don't have that choice And I think that the thing to do for them For their sake is to be able to talk about it I mean yeah it's uncomfortable But just like bear in mind that there are people [00:10:59][167]That have to think about it and that will never be able to not think about it You You Are I thought the house would be playing out I go home I don't want to go to a hospital or a research center It's a balance And Here we are Oh the House is going to get better This is one of the richest cities in the country There are so many resources here Why do you think And yet we barely we have no supporters I mean we have incredible people like the people in this field who showed up today People who have one senior citizen as you a five dollar check every month They are strangers who I never met just are all people and I know that there are there are places where the basic facts You know we understand that I'm not saying that we should not only tell you Why we get Why we get and why we get A license [00:12:53][1122]Why the young man Why do you think that that is why I think because people many people don't realize that it's not you know it's not always someone else who gets cancer and you can't go up to someone and be like hey you should think about this because [00:13:20][242]Your brother might get cancer tomorrow And that's not going to get you any friends But I mean people It's hard to get them to understand and take it to get them to understand that you having had that experience or anyplace where You will never like I mean it just changes you fundamentally And You realize that [00:13:52][313]I don't know how to do this [00:13:57][12]I mean I think it's not happening because people it's just it's because it's inconceivable It is inconceivable that someone in your family would get cancer until the moment when they do And then It's oh [00:14:14][141]Yeah it's just yeah it's inconceivable that that someone in your family would get cancer that your brother like my older sisters is 4 years older than me And I called her from Germany right after that This doctor had given me my diagnosis and I said you know she was out weeding her yard and she And I You know I picked a pick up the phone and I and I told her like Hey aaron like I [00:14:38][228]You know I'm in Germany because they knew that I was sick and I was in Senegal in West Africa And they knew that I was she knew that I was sick my both my parents did My mom met me in Germany And I said I have leukemia And she said Are you serious Because there's no way that her little brother could possibly have leukemia happens to other people It always does And It's just it's I think it's Impossible to get people to understand that [00:15:11][317]Like it doesn't my cancer doesn't doesn't like more new it doesn't give you it doesn't text you in the morning about like hey I'm like you like I'm going to come in and like you're like all show up and then you get cancer at like o'clock on Thursday Like is that OK with you like that Finally the TEB time off work doesn't do that Like it just It just shows up like you don't know when it's going to happen And I don't think that it's I don't think you can get make people understand that You know I mean I got a degree in journalism and I think words like you know words are my my business And I don't know that words can even explain that [00:15:49][374]Like accurately that Yeah I mean it happens to anybody And like I said You know I think Getting people to act on something that they don't like something so Massive and difficult and draining and And heartbreaking As [00:16:11][209]Pediatric Cancer Getting someone to act on that And even think about it is really tough So you [00:16:23][107]Talk about how you like this Well [00:16:43][142]Everything was taken away I signed up for class I had signed up for classes for the fall of my junior and senior year I didn't have a senior year at college I didn't do it I never got to go to a bar with my friends My birthday is in August and it just didn't work You know I never got you know I didn't walk I didn't graduate with my friends I [00:17:06][203]I did it's you know I didn't see them anymore and I was in the hospital and I've never been in a hospital before And I was getting infections and having all these big words thrown about like thrown around like hypo diploid And Lukemia Genesis Probably not that one but you know like these big words I didn't know what they meant And all of a sudden that's like in this world and there's all this stuff and I'm getting you know I'm getting like Ivey's in my arms and I'm getting like pumps you know pumping who knows what and to me all day and night and you know I'm getting at Like a port put in my chest that they plug in like chemotherapy And It's just yeah I mean everything was taken was taken away And [00:17:54][479]You know I mean yeah I'm like my friends would come up I was going to school in Oregon So yeah I mean they would come up on weekends but you know I mean over time That kind of faded away because [00:18:07][110]You know I mean your friends in the hospital and it's tough You know I'm sure it was hard for them You know on the drive back to Oregon like having gone and seen their really good friend in the hospital and he looks like I can't curse here again He looks like shit He you know and there's all of these pills and things and everywhere and and and all of his you know tubes and things coming out of him and you know they I mean yeah They stopped coming And You know and that's no I mean that's no You know not to say anything bad about them but I mean you know I mean there's Of course Like it was difficult And I mean especially that what the drive up all the way up here and everything but Yeah I mean I it's just it was really isolating and basically the only people Were like my sister and my parents And you know they would come up My friends would come up periodically and the nurses and That was pretty much it [00:19:09][591]Because change would change everything I mean you know I would like to snuff It Like [00:19:21][103]Yeah I mean like you like early 20s you're like aged people I mean it would be totally different for them to go visit their friend who has cancer if it was you know a place that felt more like a home in a hospital is not like I Was sure it was really difficult to see me in the hospital and don't know why I was there And I'm like if they could have gone visited me in the Ladybug House where there's like a nice yard in the back and where you know it's this beautiful place and it's like a you know and there's not so much medical stuff like around and just not being a hospital I think that would change everything You know it would be more I mean like I said like it gives you your life back So tell us what it's like to go to [00:20:20][577]Bed I didn't have that much chemo because I only had two months [00:20:31][68]Very expensive but [00:20:40][15]So OK So I you know they started I like got back to the states started the chemo the next day It was OK I will just do this No big deal And then I got an infection a fungal infection that's Crossed like when they told me about it they said it's fatal Most people who have it die from it and they couldn't They couldn't treat that infection and do chemo at the same time But I have luckily my leukemia is really responsive to the chemo So I was in remission And you know and then I just had to deal with this fungal infection and they had to put they had to take remove seven ribs and a lobe of my lung And then it was in my knee And then they took out a femur the femur and my knee and all that other stuff But I mean chemo itself like it's yeah it's terrible like you're nauseous you [00:21:37][557]I mean I don't really remember that well done No just one This one Got replaced You were there of an infection [00:21:54][131]Yeah So I mean yeah I mean getting chemo but the thing is is you can you can do chemo [00:22:02][38]But yeah I mean they you know But they were as looked at them and those these people are just as sick as I am And they're, you know, talk about inspirational, they're just going to be themselves They might stop and throw up and then they'll just go back to playing But at the same time you would think about , you'd see these parents by themselves sometimes, at the cafeteria, walking down the hall And I just think I can't imagine what you're thinking right now I can't And you know I knew a little boy who died of severe severe aplastic anemia a couple of years ago And because he couldn't find a stem cell donor And it wasn't and it was just it hit me really hard because You know he didn't he wasn't not strong enough [00:25:18][179]Like he did It's not that he didn't have enough faith in him It was that I was kind of a tangent a significant tangent but you know there just wasn't the right person on the stem cell donor registry And if that was he would still be here [00:25:31][124]That was totally attended But it will do it [00:25:36][32]Really Well no because a lot of the time [00:26:00][108]It was waiting for blood cultures to grow back And that takes a couple of days and they wouldn't They wouldn't discharge me without being on the antibiotic ever I just got tons of infections it was out of control And they wouldn't discharged me without Knowing what antibiotic to give me Which one was receptive effective against the infection I had Until so they wouldn't release me until they knew They put me on an antibiotic an oral antibiotic I could take or IV I guess And so sometimes that would be you know five days six days seven And you know I was totally fine I could have absolutely gone home In terms of how much care I needed But I we were just waiting for these little Molecules to grow and all that stuff and it was crazy Yeah [00:26:55][530]Absolutely Yeah [00:26:58][20]Yeah And that was pretty aggravating like I will say You know just like Being there and like you know I wasn't getting I wasn't having You know Not not that much was going on I was waiting like every day it was like well you know we were coming on rounds and the culture grow NoAnd it's just it's like an all you It's just really Oh it was pretty bad Yeah You could say one thing to those people who may have WhyJust why haven't they I would say what my sister said ThatCancer doesn't give you any notice It doesn't You know it doesn't it doesn't doesn't care who you are Doesn't care what's going on in your life doesn't care if you have kids you need to take care of or if you have a really all these responsibilities at your job Or if you're planning this really fun trip with your family to Disneyland or France or elsewhere And it just Doesn't care And I think that There are so many people in this community that this is their world And I think Yeah it's not pleasant to think about And it's really sad and it's really hard and it's it makes you mad that it makes you heartbroken And I think That I think that we as a community we owe it to themTo help them out That you know yes we have a choice to think about Sad thing But I think that to just decide not to is I think it's the wrong choice Because some people don't have that choice And I think you know just trying to imagine That happening to you because you know in May of 2010 like You know we didn't know anything about this whole sceneExactly YeahAnd I think you know yeah I mean it could happen to you But I think you know get involved in that at the very least listen To the stories because not necessarily only because you know while this might have [00:29:38][0
